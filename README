Two primary files:
    optimistic.c
    dijkstras.c
    
    both are executed from the entry point, which is main.c
    
    As their names indicate- optimistic.c contains an implementation of the optimistic algorithm, 
    and dijkstras.c contains banker's algorithm.


Major data structures:
    A double-ended queue (dequeue) can be found in queue.c
    
    activitiy.c creates nodes for each activity, and arranges them in a linked list.


Error checking:
    Input:
        Check order of activities for each task


Don't forget to free memory allocations

If initial claim is exceeded for bankers, abort task, print error message
